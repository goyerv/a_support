The Local filter has the highest priority—when it’s on, you’ll first see posts from runners who share your exact address or are in close proximity. With Intrastate, posts from runners within the same state appear next. Intranational shows posts from anywhere within your country, while Intracontinental expands your view to runners located anywhere on your continent. Finally, International opens up your feed to posts from runners around the globe.\\n\\nThe second category, Run Category, allows you to choose the type of requests you’re interested in. Turning on Delivery will show posts from runners focused on local deliveries, while Shipping reveals posts from runners handling longer-distance or more logistics-heavy shipping requests.\\n\\nThe third category is Medium of Transportation, which refers to how runners intend to complete their tasks. You can filter posts based on whether the runner is traveling by foot—ideal for shorter distances—or using a bike, scooter, car, bus (public transport), train, or airplane. These filters work alongside your other selections to fine-tune your feed to match your preferences.": "您打开或关闭的过滤器直接塑造了您在跑步者邮局中看到的内容。 Goyerv的过滤系统旨在根据您的喜好层面最相关的帖子，并将其分为三个主要类别：位置，运行类别和运输媒介。\\ n \\ nunder位置，过滤器优先级。本地过滤器的优先级最高 - 当它上映时，您将首先看到分享您确切地址或紧邻的跑步者的帖子。随着内在状态，接下来会出现来自同一状态的跑步者的职位。国内表演来自您所在国家内部任何地方的帖子，而室内的帖子将您的视野扩展到了大陆上任何地方的跑步者。最后，国际公司向全球跑步者的帖子打开您的供稿。\\ n \\ n第二类，跑步类别，您可以选择您感兴趣的请求类型。打开交付将显示跑步者的帖子，而跑步者的帖子专注于本地交货，而运输却揭示了跑步者的跑步者的帖子，而跑步者的较长距离或更多的物流请求的运行方式是属于运输方式。任务。您可以根据跑步者是步行行驶（较短距离的理想）或使用自行车，踏板车，汽车，公共汽车（公共交通），火车或飞机来过滤帖子。这些过滤器与您的其他选择一起使用，以微调供稿，以符合您的喜好。",
